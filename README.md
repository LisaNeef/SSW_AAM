This repository holds codes and other materials for a project examining the atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) changes associated with sudden statospheric warmings (SSWs). This work culminated in the following publication (available [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014JD021621/abstract)):  Neef, L., S. Walther, K. Matthes, and K. Kodera (2014), Observations of stratospheric sudden warmings in Earth rotation variations, J. Geophys. Res. Atmos., 119, 9666â€“9678, doi:10.1002/2014JD021621.
